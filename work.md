# Work
I am working as a Data Scientist at [Tweag I/O](https://tweag.io), a software engineering lab / consultancy. If your company is looking for competent data scientists or is interested in getting help with functional programming projects or reproducible builds and software systems, we would love to chat!
At Tweag, I also have been writing a few blog posts, among them a series of blog posts introducing important Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques:
- [Part I](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2019-10-25-mcmc-intro1/) is about Markov chains and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,
- [Part II](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2020-01-09-mcmc-intro2.html) discusses Gibbs sampling,
- [Part III](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-08-06-mcmc-intro3/) tells you everything you need to know about Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC),
- [Part IV](https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-10-28-mcmc-intro-4/) end the series with a discussion of Replica Exchange a.k.a. Parallel Tempering
